# Game-Of-War
## What is Game-Of-War
"Game-Of-War" is a card game made in C# where 2 players (in this case you and the computer) compete to win all the cards in the deck. 

 It is designed for entertainment, suitable for players of all ages.

 This project is developed by:
 - Aleksandar Stoyanov (Main coder, Team Leader)
 - Peter Petrov (Documentation, Presentation)
 - Berk Manolov (Documentation, Presentation)
 - Hristo Mihovski (Help-codder)
 - Petko Marinov (Tester)

The goal is to create a console app in C# that replicates the worldwide known card game - War.

## Rules:

- Each of the two players is dealt on half of a shuffeld deck of cards.
- Each turn, each player draws on card from their deck.
- The player that drew the card with highher value gets both cards.
- if the card drawn are the same it starts the "War".
- Each player places three cards face-down (if they have at least three cards) and then one card face-up.
- The face-up cards are compared:
- The player with the higher face-up card wins all the cards from the war (including the face-down ones).
- If there is another tie, the war process repeats.
- If a player does not have enough cards for a full war, they play as many cards as they have, and the outcome is determined from there.
- The player with the most card in their deck wins.
