|| + Each of the two players are dealt one half of a shuffled deck of cards.  ||
|| + Each turn, each player draws one card from their deck.                   ||
|| + The player that drew the card with higher value gets both cards.         ||
|| + Both cards return to the winner's deck.                                  ||
|| + If there is a draw, both players place the next three cards face down    ||
|| and then another card face-up. The owner of the higher face-up             ||
|| card gets all the cards on the table.                                      ||
||                                                                            ||
